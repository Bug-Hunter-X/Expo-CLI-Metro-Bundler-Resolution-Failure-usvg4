The solution involved several steps:

1. **Verify Module Installation:** Double-check that the module is indeed correctly installed using `npm ls <module_name>` or `yarn why <module_name>`.  Ensure the version is compatible with your project's dependencies.
2. **Check for Conflicting Packages:** Look for any conflicting package names or versions.  Different versions of the same module or packages with similar names might cause conflicts.
3. **Clear Metro Cache:** Clearing the Metro bundler cache often resolves transient issues.  This can usually be done by deleting the `.expo` and `node_modules` folders, and then reinstalling dependencies (`expo prebuild`, `expo install`, etc.).
4. **Restart the Bundler:** After cleaning the cache and reinstalling, restart the bundler. This forces a fresh rebuild with updated dependencies.
5. **Inspect `package.json`:**  Thoroughly examine your `package.json` for any typos in module names or version numbers.
6. **Examine `metro.config.js`:** if present, check your configuration file for any potential issues related to resolver settings or module mapping.

By systematically addressing these points, you can usually identify and resolve the underlying cause of the Metro bundler resolution failure.
